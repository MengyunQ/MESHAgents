## Overview

**MESHAgents** is a multi-agent reasoning framework designed for phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) in cardiovascular imaging. It orchestrates a team of domain-specialized language model agents to automatically discover phenotype‚Äìfactor associations through collaborative analysis and consensus building.

## Features

- ü§ù Multi-agent consensus mechanism for robust phenotype discovery  
- üß† Agent memory and tool modules for statistical reasoning  
- üí¨ Sequential discussion protocol inspired by clinical MDT panels  
- ü©∫ Validated on UK Biobank (N=38,000+) for 9 disease phenotypes
